# Resolving Packets from Counters: Enabling Multi-scale Network Traffic Super Resolution via Composable Large Traffic Model

Realistic fine-grained traffic traces are valuable to numerous applications in both academia and industry. It's challenging to obtain them directly, while coarse-grained counters are readily available
on all network devices. This work ZoomSynth can synthesis fine-grained trafffic from those counters and further support some downstream tasks.
